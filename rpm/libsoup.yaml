Description: |
    Libsoup is an HTTP library implementation in C. It was originally part
    of a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation called Soup, but
    the SOAP and non-SOAP parts have now been split into separate packages.
    
    libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK
    applications. This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers
    on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to
    the Gtk+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also
    supported for those who want it).
